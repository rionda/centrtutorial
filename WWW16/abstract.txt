Centrality measures allow to measure the relative importance of a node or an
edge in a graph w.r.t. other nodes or edges. Many measures of centrality have
been developed in the literature to capture different aspects of the informal
concept of importance, and algorithms for different measures have been proposed.
In this tutorial, we survey the different definitions of centrality measures and
the algorithms to compute them. We start from the most common measures (e.g.,
closeness centrality, betweenness centrality) and move to more complex ones,
like spanning-edge centrality. In our presentation, we begin
from exact algorithms and then move to approximation algorithms, including
sampling-based ones, and to highly-scalable MapReduce algorithms for huge
graphs, both for exact computation and for keeping the measures up-to-date on
dynamic graphs where edges are inserted or deleted over time.
Our goal is to show how advanced algorithmic techniques and scalable systems can
be used to obtain efficient algorithms for important graph mining tasks, and
to encourage research in the area by highlighting open problems and possible
directions.
