@article{RiondatoK15,
	Abstract = {Betweenness centrality is a fundamental measure in social network analysis, expressing the importance or influence of individual vertices (or edges) in a network in terms of the fraction of shortest paths that pass through them. Since exact computation in large networks is prohibitively expensive, we present two efficient randomized algorithms for betweenness estimation. The algorithms are based on random sampling of shortest paths and offer probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the approximation. The first algorithm estimates the betweenness of all vertices (or edges): all approximate values are within an additive factor \$\${\backslash}varepsilon {\backslash}in (0,1)\$\$ $\epsilon$ âˆˆ ( 0 , 1 ) from the real values, with probability at least \$\$1-{\backslash}delta \$\$ 1 - $\delta$ . The second algorithm focuses on the top-K vertices (or edges) with highest betweenness and estimate their betweenness value to within a multiplicative factor \$\${\backslash}varepsilon \$\$ $\epsilon$ , with probability at least \$\$1-{\backslash}delta \$\$ 1 - $\delta$ . This is the first algorithm that can compute such approximation for the top-K vertices (or edges). By proving upper and lower bounds to the VC-dimension of a range set associated with the problem at hand, we can bound the sample size needed to achieve the desired approximations. We obtain sample sizes that are independent from the number of vertices in the network and only depend on a characteristic quantity that we call the vertex-diameter, that is the maximum number of vertices in a shortest path. In some cases, the sample size is completely independent from any quantitative property of the graph. An extensive experimental evaluation on real and artificial networks shows that our algorithms are significantly faster and much more scalable as the number of vertices grows than other algorithms with similar approximation guarantees.},

@article{BergaminiM15arXiv,
	Abstract = {Betweenness is a well-known centrality measure that ranks the nodes of a network according to their participation in shortest paths. Since an exact computation is prohibitive in large networks, several approximation algorithms have been proposed. Besides that, recent years have seen the publication of dynamic algorithms for efficient recomputation of betweenness in networks that change over time. In this paper we propose the first betweenness centrality approximation algorithms with a provable guarantee on the maximum approximation error for dynamic networks. Several new intermediate algorithmic results contribute to the respective approximation algorithms: (i) new upper bounds on the vertex diameter, (ii) the first fully-dynamic algorithm for updating an approximation of the vertex diameter in undirected graphs, and (iii) an algorithm with lower time complexity for updating single-source shortest paths in unweighted graphs after a batch of edge actions. Using approximation, our algorithms are the first to make in-memory computation of betweenness in dynamic networks with millions of edges feasible. Our experiments show that our algorithms can achieve substantial speedups compared to recomputation, up to several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the approximation accuracy is usually significantly better than the theoretical guarantee in terms of absolute error. More importantly, for reasonably small approximation error thresholds, the rank of nodes is well preserved, in particular for nodes with high betweenness.},

	Abstract = {The problem of efficiently computing the betweenness centrality of nodes has been researched extensively. To date, the best known exact and centralized algorithm for this task is an algorithm proposed in 2001 by Brandes. The contribution of our paper is Brandes++, an algorithm for exact efficient computation of betweenness centrality. The crux of our algorithm is that we create a sketch of the graph, that we call the skeleton, by replacing subgraphs with simpler graph structures. Depending on the underlying graph structure, using this skeleton and by keeping appropriate summaries Brandes++ we can achieve significantly low running times in our computations. Extensive experimental evaluation on real life datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm for different types of graphs. We release our code for benefit of the research community.},
